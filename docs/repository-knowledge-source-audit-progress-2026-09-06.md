# Source-audit evaluation checkpoint — 2026-09-06

The source-audit comparison is **not complete**. There is no certified current
four-repository result, and this checkpoint does not claim parity with the
independent source audits or a regression-free improvement over main.

## Implemented and verified

Commit `fa2e0f4f84a62f13840688bb2c5d5d7898d39959` on
`feature/generalized-repository-knowledge-v2` removes an unnecessary verifier
constraint: a missing operation need not duplicate the exact citation of the
independent observation that led to it. A declaration and its consumer can
provide different evidence. Both citations still require fresh, pinned source
reads, and the observation must link to a submitted missing-operation ID.

The regression test covers different-file evidence, missing links, and unread
citations. Full suite: 2,158 passed, one skipped; typecheck and changed-file lint
passed. These are implementation checks, not evidence of extraction quality.

## Live CircleFund attempt v19

- Implementation: `fa2e0f4f84a62f13840688bb2c5d5d7898d39959`.
- Source: `arkb75/CircleFund@22d1968ff13f649ad6ce06a07714b3ecc279121f`.
- Work item: `cmtp89u6z0000bzsbnkgddnaf`.
- Refresh: `cmtp89uyd0002bzsbzwwmlfjf`.
- Independent-review generation: `cmtp8cx7y002mbzsbaocvqxl7`.
- Live artifact: `/tmp/workbase-source-audit-v27.YaErOL/circlefund-v19-live.json`.
- Started 03:04:07 UTC; finished 03:15:32 UTC; failed after about 11.4 minutes.

Four investigator waves completed, retaining 19 provisional findings. The
independent review then repeatedly received HTTP 429 from OpenRouter for
`openai/gpt-5.6-luna`. All three bounded runner attempts were exhausted. The
saved investigation checkpoints were reused between attempts; the completed
investigation was not rerun. This was not an out-of-credit response, a failed
source check, or an exhausted investigation budget.

The refresh's recorded investigation budget was 45/71 model calls,
84,895/280,000 semantic-accounting tokens, and 24/110 inspection operations.
Reported cost was $0.34051014, but this is **known cost only**, not a complete
bill: some rate-limited attempts have unknown metering. No provider/model
substitution was introduced for this run.

The work item contains **zero saved Facts and zero saved Highlights**. The
candidate audit and synthesis were not reached. Do not grade the provisional
notebook or interpret the failure as a semantic coverage score.

## Source check retained for eventual adjudication

Direct inspection of the pinned CircleFund source confirms that invite joins
create a membership only when none exists. A suspended existing membership is
rejected; a pending existing membership remains pending. The provisional
investigator summary says the join otherwise creates an active member, which
glosses over this distinction. This is an external-audit concern for the final
saved output, not a finding injected into the live investigation. It has not
yet passed through verification or synthesis.

## Metering correction

The database observer previously added `estimatedCostUsd ?? 0`, allowing an
unknown charge to masquerade as a complete total. The accompanying reporting
change preserves null for incomplete token/cost totals; it retains known token
totals when only the charge is missing and accepts explicitly reported zero
cost. It does not change generation behavior or relax execution/source gates.

OpenRouter notes that some failed requests, including certain 429 cases, can
consume credits, so a failed-request ID or a missing generation lookup is not
proof of zero charge. See [OpenRouter's reliability guidance](https://openrouter.ai/blog/insights/reliability-failover/).
Outcome verification and cost/latency diagnostics are distinct dimensions in
[Anthropic's agent-evaluation guidance](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents).

## Remaining work

1. Complete a live run once the review endpoint can serve requests reliably;
   retain the existing checkpoints and failed artifacts for diagnosis.
2. Export and inspect only its automatically applied, active Facts/Highlights.
3. Adjudicate against the frozen source units and questions, including material
   negative boundaries and evidence support.
4. Complete SoloPilot, Backer, and Otto on a consistently recorded implementation;
   compare the three matched projects against main's frozen historical controls.
5. Fix generalized semantic deficits that the saved-output comparison actually
   reveals. Do not declare success from item counts, a verifier pass, or tests alone.
